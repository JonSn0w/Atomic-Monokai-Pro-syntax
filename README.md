**Atomic Monokai Pro** features a modern interpretation of the monokai color palette, based on the [Monokai Pro](https://www.monokai.pro/) syntax-theme for Sublime Text and VSCode. After becoming accustomed to this popular syntax-theme while using Sublime Text, I decided to create this adaptation for Atom.

### Install

This theme can be installed from within Atom or via the command: 
```
>$ apm install atom-monokai-pro-syntax 
```
After installation, you can activated by going to the **Settings > Themes** section and selecting it from the **Syntax Themes** drop-down menu.
